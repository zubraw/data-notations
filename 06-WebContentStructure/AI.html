    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI Definition</a></h2>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
problem-solving, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">understanding natural language</a>,
recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>

<p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
and techniques, such as machine learning, natural
language processing, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

<h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>

<p>AI is used as voice assistants. <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri">Siri</a>, Google Assistant,
and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
recommend products or shows based on your previous
interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
roads and make driving decisions.</p>

<h2>The Future of AI</h2>

<p>AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as
healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing.
However, ethical considerations, such as job
displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also
key topics of discussion. The development of AI is
likely to reshape many industries and aspects of daily
life in the years to come.</p>


<br><h4>Key Concepts in AI</h4>
    
    In relation to artificial intelligence,
    the following key concepts can be distinguished:
    <ol>
    <li>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
    that allows systems to learn from data and improve
    over time without being explicitly programmed.
    Examples include recommendation systems (like
    Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.</li>
    
    <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI
    focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
    and generate human language. Applications include voice
    assistants like Siri or Alexa, chatbots, and language
    translation systems.</li>
    
    <li>Computer Vision: Enables machines to interpret
    and make decisions based on visual data from the world,
    such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
    recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.</li>
    
    <li>Robotics: AI powers robots, giving them the ability
    to perform tasks autonomously, often in environments
    that are too dangerous or complex for humans.</li>
    
    <li>Expert Systems: AI-based systems designed to mimic
    human expertise in specific domains, such as medical
    diagnosis or financial decision-making.</li>
    </ol>
