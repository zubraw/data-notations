    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>

<h2>AI Definition</h2>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
problem-solving, understanding natural language,
recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>

<p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
and techniques, such as machine learning, natural
language processing, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

<h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>

<p>AI is used as voice assistants. Siri, Google Assistant,
and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
recommend products or shows based on your previous
interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
roads and make driving decisions.</p>

<h2>The Future of AI</h2>

<p>AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as
healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing.
However, ethical considerations, such as job
displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also
key topics of discussion. The development of AI is
likely to reshape many industries and aspects of daily
life in the years to come.</p>
